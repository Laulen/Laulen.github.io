# About Me

<!-- <img src="https://laulen.github.io/qianqianzhang2.jpg" class="floatpic"> -->

Here is **Qianqian Zhang (Laulen, 张倩倩)**.<br>

I am a Ph.D. candidate specializing in Computer Application Technology at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/).

**09/2021**: I was recommended for admission to the Computer Application program at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences **without examination**, as an academic master's student, with a comprehensive average score of 92.27 and the top grade in my undergraduate thesis within my major.

**09/2021 - 07/2022**: I attended the School of Computer Science and Technology at **UCAS's Yanqi Lake Campus** for intensive coursework.

**2022 - 2023**: I pursued my studies at the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [NSSC](http://www.nssc.ac.cn/) in **Huairou District**, under the guidance of my master's supervisor, [Li Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0020524).

**05/2023**: I successfully passed the qualification review for transitioning from a master's to a Ph.D. program.

**02/2024**: I continued my studies as a Ph.D. student under the supervision of my doctoral advisor, [Junshe An](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0000637).

**06/2024 - 02/2025**: I resided at **UCAS's Zhongguancun Campus** and conducted research at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research (AIR) of **Tsinghua University**. My mentors, [Yunxin Liu](https://yunxinliu.github.io/), [Weijun Wang](https://weijunalexwang.github.io/), [Hao Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/fromandto), and [Yuanchun Li](https://yuanchun-li.github.io/), broadened my horizons, and I learned a great deal from them.

**February 2025**: I received an invitation letter from a supervisor at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), along with a scholarship offer from the university. My supervisors there are [Ahmed M. A. Sayed](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ahmed/) and [Qilei Li](https://li.qilei.me/). I will begin collaborating with them remotely from China in advance. If all goes well, I will travel to the UK in 09/2025 for a 6-month joint training program.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - zhangqianqian21 [at] mails.ucas.ac.cn

**<font color="#990000">I anticipate applying for a Ph.D. program in June 2026. After graduation, I will be seeking postdoctoral positions. If you have any information, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!</font>**
